# TJV register scraper
This is a scraper that runs on [Morph](https://morph.io). To get started [see Morph.io the documentation](https://morph.io/documentation)

## How it works?
1. Scraper will take data from official CSV register at https://tjv.pristupinfo.hr/ (TJV)
2. Scraped TJV CSV data will be stored to `allData` table
3. Then data will be processed and cleanup
4. Clean data will be soted to `data` table
